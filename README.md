# Gender-Recognition-with-classic-Neural-Network-BPNN-

This repository contains codes for face gender recognition with classic neural network
The acuracy up to now is not good enough

to try this code, you sould install opencv and visual studio (for windows)
you also can run our c++ codes on qt (for ubuntu).

for better performance, we have developed face gender recognition with CNN (convolutional neural network) that will be published next time
